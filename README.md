## S.E.C. Enforcement Data

This file contains 2,158 enforcement actions initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission from May 18, 2015, to Sept. 30, 2018 â€” a period covering the final 88 weeks of the Obama administration and the first 88 weeks of the Trump administration.

The file contains the following fields:

**id:** A unique identification for cases

**case_id:** A code that corresponds to the case announcement on the S.E.C. Web site

**url:** A url for the case filing that will lead to either a litigation release for civil cases, an administrative filing or a press release. Note that the S.E.C. sometimes announces multiple cases with one filing.

**defendant:** The primary defendant in the case, though there are often more named in the actual complaint.

**date_filed:** The date the action was launched, which is not always the same as the date it was announced.

**admin:** Flags whether the case was filed when Barack Obama was president or when Donald J. Trump was in office.

**fy:** The S.E.C. fiscal year runs from October through September.

**case_type:** Whether the S.E.C went to civil court, or brought the action as an administrative proceding.

**category:** Cases categorized as they are by the S.E.C. in [annual enforcement reports](https://www.sec.gov/files/enforcement-annual-report-2018.pdf).

**fs:** Denotes whether a case was simultaneously filed and settled. Many big cases are handled this way and it allows for filtering out contested cases.

**pending:** Cases are marked pending if at least one defendant has not had charges resolved.

**is_a_bank:** This field designates if one or more defendants in a case are registered as a bank. See full methodology for more on this.

**is_public:** This field shows whether one or more defendants in a case is a U.S.-traded public company. Penny-stock firms and others with less than $300 million market capitalization are excluded.

**large_cap:** This shows whether one or more defendants is a "Large Cap" company, with a market capitalization of at least $10 billion.

**amount:** This is the amount of disgorgement, interest and penalty ordered paid as a result of the S.E.C. action. It excludes money ordered but waived by the S.E.C. due to related actions in criminal cases, lawsuits and international investigations. 

**full_amount:** This is the total of all money ordered paid as a result of the S.E.C. action. This is the figure commonly used by the agency.
